            <p>My goal is to show information about the staggering amount of species that have been killed and the effect that our actions have had on marine life and future population growth. In order to make the website stand out, I'm going to try to include the six design components to my website. I will have three pages with the navigation bar to link them together.</p>

            <h2>Our actions that affected the world's ecosystem</h2>
            <p>Human activities have a profound impact on sea animals, leading to various factors contributing to their deaths. Pollution, whether from industrial sources, agriculture, or plastic waste, poses a significant threat by contaminating oceans and harming marine life. Oil spills are particularly devastating, causing catastrophic effects on marine ecosystems. Overfishing is another common cause, depleting fish populations, disrupting food chains, and resulting in decreased biodiversity and loss of habitats for sea creatures. Climate change exacerbates these issues, with rising ocean temperatures, acidification, and extreme weather events negatively affecting marine ecosystems and sea animal health. Additionally, habitat destruction, illegal fishing practices such as dynamite fishing and bycatch, and diseases and parasites further jeopardize sea animals' survival. It is crucial to address these challenges by implementing sustainable fishing practices, reducing pollution, and taking decisive action against climate change to safeguard marine life and their habitats.</p>

            <h2>What We Can Do to Help</h2>
            <p>We can do our part for sea animals by being mindful of our fishing choices and opting for sustainable seafood options. It's also crucial to reduce plastic waste and support recycling initiatives to keep our oceans clean and safe for marine creatures. Supporting marine protected areas is essential as it provides a sanctuary for sea animals to thrive without human interference. Taking steps to combat climate change, such as using clean energy sources and supporting conservation efforts, is key to safeguarding sea animals and their habitats. Lastly, spreading awareness and educating others about the importance of ocean conservation can inspire more people to join in the effort to protect sea animals.</p>
